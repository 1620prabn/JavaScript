# JS Module 1 session 2.2

This was a continuation of session 2 where we learned about conditions, loops and functions as well as more advanced data types such as arrays and objects.

Before going over the homework please familiarize yourself with the review document that contains all of the exercises performed during class. Please look out especially for those exercises we did not have time to perform in class. You are not expected to be able to complete these exercises without guidance, but the solutions for the exercises are in the review document as well, so it's a good way to recap the class before doing the exercises.

## Step 1: Echo a string - warm up exercise (1 hour)

Go read the [javascript documentation on Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substring) about the substring method and how to apply it to strings.

Here is a quick example to get you started:
```
let text = "This is a string";
console.log(text.substring(2)); // "is is a string"
console.log(text.substring(5)); // "is a string"
console.log(text.substring(12)); // "ring"
```

Build a function that takes a string as an argument and make it console log the string in an "echoed" way like this (given the input "hello")

```
// hello
// ello
// llo
// lo
// o
```

Given another string ("pizza")

```
// pizza
// izza
// zza
// za
// a
```

Or "græskar"

```
// græskar
// ræskar
// æskar
// skar
// kar
// ar
// r
```

Please save your solution to this problem in a file and commit and push it to your github repository. Once you have it on github
post a link on Slack. The deadline is next class, but if you are able to hand it in sooner we have the chance to review it before class so you can get feedback.

## Step 3: Reorganize your Github (2 hours)

Your Github should contain two repositories called hyf-javascript1 and hyf-commandline . Inside the JavaScript repository you should have three folders, called week1, week2, and week3 (or something similar). Inside these folders you should have the different assignments (a file per exercises). Ty and find proper names for the exercises that reflect somehow what is going on in the code. Avoid using spaces in your file names, this makes it harder to "run" you files. Also make sure that all your JavaScript files have a .js extension.
