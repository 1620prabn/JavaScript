## Homework Week 2

>[Here](/Week2/README.md) you find the readings you have to complete before the third lecture.

## Step 1: Recap/Read

- Have a look at [The Secret Life of JavaScript Primitives](https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/09/27/the-secret-life-of-javascript-primitives/)
- Go through the review of [last week](/Week1/REVIEW.md) (Work in progress, update this week :wrench:)
- Go through the review of [this week](/Week2/REVIEW.md) (work in progress, update this week :nut_and_bolt:)

## Step 2: JavaScript
> For all the following exercises create a new .js file. Try to find a proper name for each file or make a small comment about what it does inside for future reference

1. Create a function that takes 3 arguments and returns the sum of the three arguments.

2. Create a function named `colorCar` that receives a color, and prints out, "a red car" for example. (Hint: put it in your file and run it like before.)

3. Create an object and a function that takes the object as a parameter and prints out all of its names and values.

4. Create a function named `vehicleType` that receives a color, and a code, 1 for car, 2 for motorbike. And prints "a blue motorbike" for example when called as `vehicleType("blue", 2)`

5. Can you write the following without the `if` statement, but with just as a single line with `console.log(...);`?
```js
if (3 == 3) {
    console.log("true")
} else {
    console.log("false")
}
```

6. Create a function called `vehicle`, like before, but takes another parameter called age, so that `vehicle("blue", 1, 5)` prints "a blue used car"

7. Make a list of vehicles, you can add `"motorbike"`, `"caravan"`, `"bike"`, or more.

8. How do you get the third element from that list?

9. Change the function `vehicle` to use the list of question 4. So that `vehicle("green", 3, 1)` prints "a green new caravan".

10. Use the list of vehicles to write an advertisement. So that it prints something like: `"Amazing Joe's Garage, we service cars, motorbikes, caravans and bikes."`. (Hint: use a `for` loop.)

11. What if you add one more vehicle to the list, can you have that added to the advertisement without changing the code for question 7?

12. Create an empty object

13. Create a function that takes two objects as parameters and compares them. You will actually need to write two functions — one that compares with `==` and one that compares with `===`. Remember that objects can have objects inside of them so you'll need to find a way to compare every element of every object (types and values). For example: 

```js
var obj1 = {
  a: 1,
  b: "this is the letter b",
  c: {
    foo: "what is a foo anyway",
    bar: [1, 2, 3, 4]
  }
};

var obj2 = {
  a: "1",
  b: "this is the letter b",
  c: {
    foo: "what is a foo anyway",
    bar: [1, 2, 3, 4]
  }
};
```

    In our example we'll say that `obj1 == obj2` is `true` and `obj1 === obj2` is `false`. Make sure you can see why before you write any code!
    
    Note: give this exercise your best shot but don’t spend more than, say, one hour on it.

14. We saw that we can pass functions as arguments to other functions. Your task is to write a function that takes another function as an argument and runs it. 

```js
    function foo(func) {
        // What to do here? 
    }
    
    function bar() {
        console.log('Hello, I am bar!');
    }
    
    foo(bar);
```


15. Write some code to test two arrays for equality using `==` and `===`. Test the following:
    
```js
var x = [1, 2, 3];
var y = [1, 2, 3];
var z = y;
```

What do you think will happen with `x == y`, `x === y` and `z == y` and `z == x`? Prove it!
    
> Don't cheat! Seriously - try it first.
    

Check out this [Fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/jimschubert/85M4z/). You need to open your browser’s Developer Tools to see the console output. Press the Run button in the upper right corner to run the code.

More insights from this [Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22395357/how-to-compare-two-arrays-are-equal-using-javascript).


16. Take a look at the following code: 

```js
     var o1 = { foo: 'bar' };
     var o2 = { foo: 'bar' };
     var o3 = o2;

```

    Show that changing `o2` changes `o3` (or not) and changing ~~`o2` changes `o3`~~ `o1` changes `o3`(or not). 
    
    Does the order that you assign (`o3 = o2` or `o2 = o3`) matter? {Jim Cramer: ???}

17. What does the following code return? (And why?)
```js
let bar = 42; 
typeof typeof bar;
```

 
> ‘Coerce' means to try to change - so coercing `var x = '6'` to number means trying to change the type to number temporarily. 


## Step 3: **Finish basic freeCodeCamp challenges:**

Go back to FreeCodeCamp, start where you left of and finish the rest of the Basic JavaScript challenges.

Please make sure you REALLY understand the exercises below:
- https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/multiply-two-decimals-with-javascript
- https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/store-multiple-values-in-one-variable-using-javascript-arrays
- https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-javascript-objects
- https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/add-new-properties-to-a-javascript-object
- https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/delete-properties-from-a-javascript-object

```
How to hand in your homework:
• Upload your homework in your "hyf-javascript1" Github repository. Make sure to create a new folder "week2" first. 
• Upload your homework files inside the week2 folder and write a description for this “commit”.
• Your hyf-javascript1/week2 should now contain all your homework files.
• Place the link to your repository folder in Trello.
```

## Step 4  

**1**   
Today is Sunday and you ask your friend in how many days you are meeting. If the friend says
I will see you in 9 days. The output should be Tuesday.

You should get the today's day from the system.

So typical console output is:


``Today is: Sunday``    
``How many days to meet : 9``  
``We are meeting on : Tuesday``  



Hint: ask each other for help/ask the right questions to the mentors.

**2**  

1. Write a JavaScript program
    - Create an object of ``Students`` with properties: ``firstName``, ``lastName``, ``address``, ``telephone``, ``postCode``, ``course``, ``grade``.
    - Create array of objects of students that reflects  your class. Give random grades to each students
    anything between 60 and 95. Makes sure students names reflects your class mates. Assume everybody
    lives in Copenhagen area.
    - Create a function for finding average class grade.
    - Create a function for finding student who has got the lowest grade. Put an encouraging message.
    - Create a function for for finding student who got the highest grade. Put a celebration message.

2. Write a JavaScript program which iterates the integers from 1 to 1000. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

3. Write a JavaScript program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop. This might be bit of a challenge but read on nested for loop.
    ````js
        *
        * *
        * * *
        * * * *
        * * * * *
        * * * * * *
    ````


**3 (Challenge - only do this one once you have finished 1 and 2). Please work closely with your pair we identified in class.**

I would strongly recommend play the game couple of times and adjust the step below if 
necessary. See also the flow chart we gave you.

1. Create an object of ``card``
2. Create an object of ``player`` with the following : ``name``, ``age``, ``winner``
3. Create an object for ``game`` with the following variables: array of four players and four arrays of cards.
4. Each array belongs to one player.
5. Create a function to distribute the cards to the four arrays.
6. Take the next player in the array. 
7. Find cards with highest frequency.
8. Go to the next player and see if the player has the card you want
9. If it does continue and go to 7. If not go to 6.
10. If at any point there is one happy family in one of the array change the winner key to "true"
declare winner.
