If you feel you need preparation for the test we recommend to do the following:
• Take a look at the topics listed in the [README](https://github.com/HackYourFuture) of this repo (up to and including week 9). 
• Review all the _REVIEW.md_ files in every week.
• Look up the concepts you are struggling with in your __Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript__ book :books:. 
• It's also useful to go through the reading material and homework of the last weeks.
```
