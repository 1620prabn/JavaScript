/*
1. Create your own promise that resolves with a message after 2 seconds

2. Use the promise: When the promise is fulfilled create an alert with
  the message

3. Now make the promise fail by rejecting it with an error message
  instead of resolving it, and log the error message to the console

4. Create a new function that returns a promise. This function should have two 
parameters: successMessage and errorMessage. When you resolve the promise it should
be resolved with the successMessage and when you reject the promise it should be 
rejected with the errorMessage.
